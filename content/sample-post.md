# My First Blog Post

This is a sample blog post that demonstrates our custom markdown features.

## Profanity Example

Here's a sentence with <prof>explicit content that should be hidden by default</prof><safe>family-friendly content</safe>.

## Tooltip Example

I did something amazing <tt text="This happened on February 27th, 2024">yesterday</tt>!

## Regular Markdown

You can still use all the regular markdown features like:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)

```go
// Even code blocks work!
func hello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```
